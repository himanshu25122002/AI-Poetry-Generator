## 📝 AI Poetry Generator – Custom GPT-2 Text Generation

AI Poetry Generator is a custom-built generative AI system that produces original poetry using a transformer-based language model. This project demonstrates the creation and fine-tuning of a GPT-2 architecture from scratch on a curated poetry dataset. Despite limited compute, the system achieves fluent and stylistically rich poetic generation, showcasing core understanding of language modeling and creative AI applications.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Model Definition**  
   Built a GPT-2-like architecture from scratch using PyTorch

2. **Loading Pre-Trained Weights**   
   Loaded GPT-2 weights, which are public
   
3. **Dataset Preparation**  
   Tokenized a custom dataset of poetry, applied padding, sequence splitting, and special tokens

4. **Fine-Tunning**  
   Trained the model with cross-entropy loss and scheduled learning rate

5. **Text Generation**  
   Generated poetry using sampling techniques like temperature scaling and top-k filtering
